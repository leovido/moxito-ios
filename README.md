Moxito is an iOS application that integrates with Farcaster's social protocol to track and manage Moxie rewards. The app showcases modern iOS development practices, SwiftUI implementation, and robust architecture patterns.

## Impact
- 🏆 Won $10500 in hackathon prizes (Devfolio + Airstack Retro Grant)
- 📱 100+ TestFlight users
- 👥 1.1K organic followers on Farcaster
- ⭐ Featured by Airstack and Moxie team
- 🎨 Viral iOS widgets that users loved

## Why Moxito?
Moxito was born in Farcaster, a social platform where [Moxie](https://moxie.xyz/) started. I participated in a Hackathon and won second prize and a Retro Grant placing as a finalist. 

Moxito started as a convenience app to track $MOXIE rewards, leveraging the Subgraphs and APIs provided by [Moxie](https://developer.moxie.xyz/). The following image shows an iOS widget that shows "Daily" and "Claimable" tokens.

Moxito evolved to be a fitness and health app, promoting and rewarding good healthy habits.
Users get rewards for walking, running, and doing any physical activity. HealthKit is used to fetch the health data and an algorithm would calculate the rewards based on effort (steps, calories burned, distance, heart rate, etc.)

## 📝 Note on Code Quality

This project was built during the Moxiethon hackathon with a focus on 
shipping to real users quickly. Some architectural decisions prioritized 
speed over perfection.

**What I'd do differently today:**
- Improve backend architecture (AWS Lambda structure)
- Better error handling and resilience
- Stronger separation of concerns

**But it worked:** 100+ TestFlight users, $10.5K in prizes, 1.1K followers.

Sometimes shipping fast beats perfect code. This taught me that.

Implements sophisticated background task handling for data updates:

- Background tasks for data synchronization
- Background processing of health data
- Background processing of step count data

## 🔒 Security Features
