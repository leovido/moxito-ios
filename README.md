Moxito is an iOS application that integrates with Farcaster's social protocol to track and manage Moxie rewards. The app showcases modern iOS development practices, SwiftUI implementation, and robust architecture patterns.

## Why Moxito?
Moxito was born in Farcaster, a social platform where [Moxie](https://moxie.xyz/) started. I participated in a Hackathon and won second prize and a Retro Grant placing as a finalist. 

Moxito started as a convenience app to track $MOXIE rewards, leveraging the Subgraphs and APIs provided by [Moxie](https://developer.moxie.xyz/). The following image shows an iOS widget that shows "Daily" and "Claimable" tokens.

Moxito evolved to be a fitness and health app, promoting and rewarding good healthy habits.
Users get rewards for walking, running, and doing any physical activity. HealthKit is used to fetch the health data and an algorithm would calculate the rewards based on effort (steps, calories burned, distance, heart rate, etc.)

## 📱 Key Components

### Authentication
The app implements a secure authentication flow using `ASWebAuthenticationSession` and Sign in with Farcaster login.

### Data Management
Robust data handling with protocol-based services:

- `MoxitoClient`: Handles Farcaster authentication and data fetching
- `HealthKitService`: Manages health data integration
- `StepCountViewModel`: Centralizes step count data and calculations

### Background Processing
Implements sophisticated background task handling for data updates:

- Background tasks for data synchronization
- Background processing of health data
- Background processing of step count data

## 🔒 Security Features

- Secure credential storage using Keychain
- URL scheme validation for deep links
- Error handling with Sentry integration
- Encrypted data persistence

## 🎯 Code Quality

- SwiftLint integration for code consistency
- Comprehensive error handling
- Unit tests
- Documentation and code comments
- Type-safe implementations

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

- Efficient caching mechanisms
- Background task optimization
- Memory management best practices
- Network request batching
